        Polymorphism:-
        <p style="font-size: small;">
            Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: <br>poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.
        </p>
        <h3>Types Of Polymorphism</h3>
        <p>
            1. Rum-time Polymorphism
            <br>
            2.
            compile-time Polymorphism
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: small;">
            We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
        </p>
        Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java:- <br>It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        Runtime Polymorphism in Java:- <br>
        It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. <br>This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. <br>That base function is said to be overridden.

        Abstraction:-
        <p style="font-size: small;">
            As per dictionary, abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. For example, when you consider the case of e-mail, complex details such as what happens as soon as you send an e-mail, the protocol your e-mail server uses are hidden from the user. Therefore, to send an e-mail you just need to type the content, mention the address of the receiver, and click send.

Likewise in Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it. In Java programming, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.

    <h2>
        Inheritance:-
        <p style="font-size: small;">
            Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).
